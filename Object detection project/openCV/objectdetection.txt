whole project consist of these basic functionality-->

Background subtracting 
color filterring
edge detection
feature matching for object recognization
general object deteection

Basic libraries used-->Numpy Matplotlib and opencv 

For object detection -->

#opencv is library of python it is a image and video processing library
#OpenCV is used for all sorts of image and video analysis, like facial recognition and detection, license plate reading,
